00:08.579 --> 00:09.984

00:12.244 --> 00:15.769
8  hours of landing but there are still no signs of first contact

00:15.846 --> 00:19.423
the objects measure atleast 1500 feet tall

00:19.431 --> 00:21.041
mumma whats going to happen ?

00:21.091 --> 00:22.111
mom: I don't know 

00:22.142 --> 00:25.157
more objects like this have landed around the world. 

00:25.359 --> 00:26.069
knock knock 

00:26.063 --> 00:26.958
dr. bags

00:28.003 --> 00:28.588

00:28.599 --> 00:34.009

00:38.196 --> 00:39.401
is that ..

00:40.963 --> 00:42.963
not everyone is able to cross the experiences like this 

00:43.611 --> 00:45.611
think last time you did something stressfull

00:45.506 --> 00:46.631
does not count 

00:49.814 --> 00:51.249
enhance as soon as possible

00:59.584 --> 00:59.999

01:05.972 --> 01:07.012

01:08.994 --> 01:09.259
what happens now ?

01:10.149 --> 01:12.004
they arrive... Oh my god 

01:16.219 --> 01:16.794
company

01:16.902 --> 01:17.967
we are one of 12

01:18.501 --> 01:20.501
we have world with no single leader

01:20.721 --> 01:22.006
its impossible to deal with just one of us 

01:24.230 --> 01:25.985
how do we clarify .. they have intentions 

01:25.792 --> 01:27.277
i go back in 

01:27.426 --> 01:29.426
I guess i have right to tell you that you are putting yourself on risk.

01:30.988 --> 01:32.988
I know that's proper introduction

01:35.782 --> 01:39.287
I feel like everything when happens comes down to two of us.

01:40.837 --> 01:42.532
i know what it is 

01:42.166 --> 01:42.996
what is it ?

01:44.488 --> 01:44.998
offer weapon

01:48.589 --> 01:50.589
I don't need an interpretor to know what does this mean

01:51.520 --> 01:55.005
we don't know if they understand the difference between a weapon and tool

01:56.893 --> 01:58.273
trying to just threaten to destroy their shell

01:59.007 --> 02:01.007
whatever they do ... France and Korea will follow

02:01.883 --> 02:03.188
we are facing global war

02:05.180 --> 02:07.180
we need to talk to the other sides

02:08.014 --> 02:09.254
and work together for once

02:09.258 --> 02:12.058
we have 15 hours before this all goes to hell

02:13.836 --> 02:15.386
are you dreaming in your language ?

02:15.462 --> 02:17.462
i know why they are here

02:18.483 --> 02:19.768
what the hell is she doing ?

02:21.813 --> 02:22.028
do you trust me ?
